## Description
#### A webpage where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie and their age. The webpage should let them know how much their movie ticket will cost, based on those three factors.

### These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

* The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
* The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
